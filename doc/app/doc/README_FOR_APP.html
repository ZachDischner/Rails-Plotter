<h1 id="label-Introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to the interactive database plotting web engine, built in Ruby on
Rails. If you’re reading this, then its likely you are trying to connect
this app with your database. If so, read on.</p>

<p>This was built for the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)
in Boulder, Colorado. Its AIM is to enable quick visulization of database
numeric data, without spending months developing your own custom solutions.
Since LASP has a diverse scientific community, using many different
database engines and schemas, I tried to make this app as generic as I
could, so that it may work for any of them.</p>

<p>To date (July 1 2012), I have successfully tested this app with the
following databases:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>MySQL</p>
</li><li>
<p>PostgreSQL</p>
</li><li>
<p>SQLite</p>
</li></ul>

<p>it should perform for other setups as well, but they have not been examined
yet.</p>

<h1 id="label-Getting+Started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>The best way to get started is to load up a demo and try it out. BEWARE,
The hardest thing is getting Ruby/Ruby on Rails/ RoR + Databases to work
cohesively.</p>

<h2 id="label-Environment">Environment</h2>

<p>Obviously, you’ll need to have Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and a Database client
installed on your machine. SQLite and MYSQL sample databases are included
with this app for testing.  Getting Ruby/RoR is notoriously difficult for
some reason, though in practice it should be very simple. Here is a basic
tutorial: <a
href="http://eddorre.com/posts/rails-ultimate-install-guide-on-os-x-lion-using-rvm-homebrew-and-pow">eddorre.com/posts/rails-ultimate-install-guide-on-os-x-lion-using-rvm-homebrew-and-pow</a>
I went through a similar tutorial, and searching through google got me
though any problems I ran into.</p>

<p>This app is built using:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Ruby 1.9.3-p125</p>
</li><li>
<p>Rails 3.2.3</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Using different versions of Ruby or Rails is known to cause some headaches.
They may be easily fixed, but I’ve never felt the need to try. Consider
yourself warned.</p>

<p>I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend using a nice GUI to help manage
everything. RubyMine is my weapon of choice: <a
href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby">www.jetbrains.com/ruby</a> It is easy
to use, very intelligent, and has great integration with GIT version
control systems. It also has tools to manage your versions of Ruby and
Gems, which are much easier to use than trying to do it all from the
Command Line.</p>

<h2 id="label-Databases">Databases</h2>

<p>Included in this package is a self contained SQLite3 table, and a script
that will create a MySQL database and table.</p>
